Although I've dabbled with computers as a hobby for most of my life, I never really considered pursuing any formal education in computer science until a couple of years ago. When I began to witness how automation was starting to nibble along the edges of my profession, I decided that it was time to buckle down and figure out how to adapt.

My first foray into learning more about computer science was enrolling in MIT's [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11 "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python") offered online through EdX. I highly recommend this course to anyone thinking about pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I found it to be both accessible to beginners like me as well as sufficiently challenging. After completing the course and still wanting to learn more, I somewhat randomly picked up the book [C++ Primer Plus](https://www.amazon.com/Primer-Plus-6th-Developers-Library/dp/0321776402 "C++ Primer Plus") and worked my way through about three quarters of the chapters. After comlpeting that, I wasn't really sure what to do next.

Overall, while I found self-studying to be interesting, I missed the structure that comes from working through a formal degree program (I missed the comradery with fellow students as well!) So I began exploring my options for obtaining a degree in Computer Science. Since I already posessed a Bachelor's degree, I wanted to make sure I found a program which would allow me to focus my attention entirely on CS coursework (i.e., I didn't want to have to re-take Writing 101 or various other core curriculum courses). Thankfully, I came across Oregon State's PostBacc program in Computer Science which is designed exclusively for candidates that already posess a Bachelor's degree and fit my requirements exactly. I applied to the program and was accepted in November of 2017.

Why OSU?
---------
I found OSU's program to be virtually identical to the typical Computer Science undergraduate program offered at most major universities. This was important to me, as I wanted to learn the foundations of Computer Science and not just learn how to write code. The program requires the completion of 60 overall credit hours earned through taking the following 4-credit courses:

* Intro to Computer Science I
* Intro to Computer Science II
* Discrete Structures in Computer Science
* Data Structures
* Computer Architecture and Assembly Language
* Web Development
* Introduction to Databases
* Analysis of Algorithms
* Operating Systems
* Software Engineering I
* Software Engineering II
* Introduction to Computer Networks
* Computer Science Capstone

Eight of the 60 credit hours must be earned by taking electives, and the program currently offers electives in Usability Engineering, Security, Open Source Development, Parallel Programming, and Mobile/Cloud Software Development.

The only major difference I've noticed between the OSU PostBacc program and the typical CS undergraduate program is the OSU program's lack of formal math coursework. OSU does require all students to have completed College Algebra in their prior degree at a minimum (although based upon my review of the admissions threads posted on the [Introduction to OSU CS PostBacc reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OSUOnlineCS/ "OSU CS PostBacc reddit"), it seems applicants need to have completed at least Calculus I in order to have a realistic chance of being admitted). That being said, most CS programs require more than just Calculus I. However, you can take math courses just about anywhere and I appreciate not having to pay OSU tuition for such courses. Personally, I'm working my way through Calc II, Cal III, and Linear Algebra at a local community college concurrently with my enrollment in the program.

As of May 2018, OSU charges $478 per credit hour which translates to a cost of roughly $30,000 for completing the degree. I feel that this tuition is fair and in line with the in-state tuition rates at most large public universities.

My Plan
--------
My current plan is to complete my degree over the course of 4-5 years taking a single class per term (OSU's campus is on a quarter system and offers 4 formal terms year plus a summer session). With a full time job and a family at home, I'm finding this pace to be demanding but not all-consuming. Thankfully, my wife has been very understanding with regard to making sure I have plenty of time to study and complete homework assignments. This would be impossible to do without her support. In addition to taking courses at OSU (as well as the aforementioned math courses at my local community college), I've begun slowly working on building a portfolio of personal programming projects in my limited spare time. I hope to write about more about these projects on this blog very soon.

Several people have asked me what I plan to do once I complete the degree. My answer to that question is that I'm not entirely sure yet. I really love my current job and have no desire to leave. I expect that I will be able to apply some of my new skills in computer science and programming toward my current position, but I'm not sure how that will play exactly out just yet. I'll just have to see what sort of technological changes happen to my profession over the coures of the next several years and react accordingly.

Final Thoughts
---------------
Overall, I'm thrilled to be formally studying computer science and have been extremely satisfied with my experience at OSU so far (I hope to write up a formal reflection on the first two courses I have taken sometime soon). To anyone potentially interested in studying computer science "later in life", I would definitely recommend exploring some of the free online computer science MOOCs as a means of determining whether a more formal degree program is right for you. If so, it's great that programs such as OSU's exist which make a second bachelor's degree a realistic option.
