My interest in computer science goes back to my youth when I picked up a copy of the book Turbo C++ Programming 101 from my local library. While I was fascinated by the concept of programming as a teenager, I never pursued any formal education in computer science. However, after observing how my current profession was being rapidly transformed by information technology, I decided to correct that mistake. In the Winter of 2018 I enrolled in the B.S. in Computer Science program at Oregon State University. This blog will chronicle my thoughts and experiences as I learn computer science in my 30s. Maybe this time around Iâ€™ll finally be able to understand pointers!
